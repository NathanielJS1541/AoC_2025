# Nat's Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

I'm taking the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as an opportunity to
brush up on some scripting skills for the early challenges, learn some new
languages for the middle challenges, and probably fall back to some languages I
know relatively well for the harder challenges (if I even get that far!).

This means that each of my solutions will likely be quite long and have a lot of
unnecessary "fluff", but I'm hoping to be left with some good templates in
different languages that I'll be able to pick up quickly in the future.

I've put each day's solution in a different directory to account for the
structures needed for different languages, or languages that require
supplementary files (i.e. `Makefile`). The table below can be used as a brief
overview of which challenges I've solved, and which languages I've used to do
so.
