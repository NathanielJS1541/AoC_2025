# Nat's Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

I'm taking the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as an opportunity to
brush up on some scripting skills for the early challenges, learn some new
languages for the middle challenges, and probably fall back to some languages I
know relatively well for the harder challenges (if I even get that far!).

I've put each day's solution in a different directory to account for the
structures needed for different languages, or languages that require
supplementary files (i.e. `Makefile`). The table below can be used as a brief
overview of which challenges I've solved, and which challenges I've done to do
so.
